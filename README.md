# QuizzGameTwitch

This project is an idea after hearing a French streamer spoke about it.

The purpose of this project is to realize a quizz game which will be started by the streamer and could be joined by an amount of several viewers. 

It's a fun project and allow me to go deeper in the golang language. Here is an overview with the main ideas.

- Quizz game with serval question/answer sorted by difficulties and subjects. One question, four answers.
- For each question passed, the difficulty of the questions have to increase.
- I would like over 50 players by session.
- Each player can earn experience.
- Each player get an amount of experience point based on your ranking during the game. (We could imagine if you are not at least 25/20 you'll gain 0 points.
- Ranking system with title (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinium,...).
- Ranking list access (All of Fame).
- A database will be provided to allow the streamer to keep a progression for his community and for the questions.
- The game could be played over the Twitch chat room for viewers and via web page for the streamer.
- A server will be started each time the streamer wants to play. (It won't be hosted for the moment).
- A way to add new question, difficulties and sbjects should be provided.

This project could take me a lot of time because I could only do it during my free time but it would great to be able to provide something which can be played.
